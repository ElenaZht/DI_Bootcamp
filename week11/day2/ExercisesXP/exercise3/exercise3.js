//1. Convert this JS object into a JSON object. 
// What happens to the nested objects ?
const marioGameJson = JSON.stringify(marioGame)
console.log(marioGameJson)
// {"detail":"An amazing game!","characters":{"mario":{"description":"Small and jumpy. Likes princesses.","height":10,"weight":3,"speed":12},"bowser":{"description":"Big and green, Hates princesses.","height":16,"weight":6,"speed":4},"princessPeach":{"description":"Beautiful princess.","height":12,"weight":2,"speed":2}}}
//*Answer: method JSON.stringify converts object to 
//* json format including nested objects automatically

//2. Convert and pretty print this JS object into a JSON object.
//  Hint : Check out the JSON lesson on the platform.
const marioGameJsonPretty = JSON.stringify(marioGame, null, 2)
console.log(marioGameJsonPretty) // json object with indent of size 2

//3. Use your web inspector to add a breakpoint. 
// Check the values of the JSON object in the debugger.
//*Answer:

// marioGame :  {detail: 'An amazing game!', characters: {â€¦}}
// marioGameJson : "{\"detail\":\"An amazing game!\",\"characters\":{\"mario\":{\"description\":\"Small and jumpy.
